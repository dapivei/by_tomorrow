    "I want to build intelligent systems that can communicate with humans effectively and enable individuals to achieve their goals. Today’s systems are often opaque, brittle, and difficult to control, which limits their usefulness in human-centered applications. To make them our trustworthy collaborators, my research aims to (i) understand the computational foundation of generalization in novel scenarios, and (ii) build interactive systems that align with user’s goals.\n",

    "Here are some directions I’m excited about nowadays:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Robustness: Machine learning models are trained on a fixed and often biased dataset, but face a constantly-changing world. How can we build predictors that align with human rationales, avoid spurious correlations, and generalize to out-of-distribution data? How can models adapt quickly given new information?\n",
    "- Truthfulness: We are increasingly relying on machine learning models (e.g., large language models) for critical tasks. How can we make sure that the model outputs conform to facts? Does the model know what it doesn’t know? Can it output a “proof” for its answer? How do we evaluate factuality efficiently for questions beyond the ability of an average person?\n",
    "- Human-AI collaboration: We want AI agents to deal with our daily minutiae, support our decision-making, and teach us complex concepts. How should the agent infer user intention and preferences, allow for fine-grained control, and take (natural language) feedback? How will this collaboration shape the future workforce?\n",

    "I enjoy studying real world language usages with simple and generalizable models. I also build benchmarks that allows us to evaluate NLP models, conduct model analysis, and bring the progresses in English NLP to a wider range of languages. Here are research topics that I am currently interested in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continual Learning and Knowledge Editing: While LMs retain vast amounts of world knowledge seen during pretraining, such knowledge can get outdated. I am interested in retrieval augmentation and updating parametric knowledge in LMs.\n",
    "- Long-form Question Answering: Enabling systems to produce paragraph-level answers opens up possiblities to handle more complicated questions and provide more comprehensive answers. LFQA merges two challenging research areas -- information retrieval and text generation. Furthermore, we have to synthesize information from multiple documents.\n",
    "- Human-LM Interaction: NLP systems are getting deployed fast and widely. I am interested in improving human interactions with LM, for example, how should we present information such that users will not be misled by plausible yet imperfect model predictions? The deployment of models also creates opportunities to learn from interaction with users.\n",
    "- Spoken Language Processing: Spoken language exhibits richer prosodic features that are absent in written text. Can we build textless NLP system which can work on speech signals, opening doors to handle languages without written scripts?\n",
