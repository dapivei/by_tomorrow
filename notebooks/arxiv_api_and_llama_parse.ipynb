      "Establishing a causal relationship between code pretraining and downstream performance is difficult. Earlier studies have tackled these questions by comparing off-the-shelf code and no-code models (see, inter alia, Kim et al. 2024; Coda-Forno et al. 2024). Such observational studies are limited by the design choices of model creators and the availability of information about hyperparameters and training data. Many of the models typically surveyed are proprietary, and don’t disclose this information. While pairs of open-source models differing only in their pretraining corpora do exist, such as Llama 2 & Code Llama (Touvron et al., 2023; Roziere et al., 2023) or Gemma & CodeGemma (Gemma Team et al., 2024; Google, 2024), they often come with two important caveats: first, the code-variants of the models are derived by taking the non-code variants and conducting additional pretraining on code data, meaning the comparisons cannot control for total data volume; second, each pair treats the inclusion of code data as a binary variable, either present or absent, frustrating attempts to explore how changes in the amount of code influence downstream behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "We address these issues directly. We construct datasets that mix natural-language and source-code data at varying ratios, treating code inclusion as a continuous variable. We then pretrain language models of equal size on these parameterized datasets in two different experimental setups: a competitive setting where we keep the total volume of training data constant and vary the percentage allocated between code and natural language; and an additive setting where we keep the volume of language data constant and add additional amounts of code on top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous work has found that augmenting training data with synthetic formal languages instantiating compositional patterns can improve compositional generalization (Papadimitriou & Jurafsky, 2023; Yao & Koller, 2024; Lindemann et al., 2024). Like formal languages, source code has a number of qualities which may aid models on seemingly-unrelated tasks: it is highly structured, by virtue of its conformance to the syntax of the programming language its written in; it is generally high-quality, owing to the use of linting and bug-checking tools and programming methodologies employed by its authors; it has interpretable semantics which is grounded by the functionality it describes; and, notably for compositionality, it contains instances of identical arguments and functions (e.g., variable names and method signatures). Informed by these observations, we evaluate our trained models for compositional generalization by finetuning them on three compositional generalization benchmarks (COGS, COGS-vf, and English Passivization). We also measure their performance on a broad array of tasks from BigBench to see how well code helps or hurts performance on unrelated domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "We find that including code in a model’s pretraining corpus has noticeable impacts on its performance on downstream tasks, in varying directions. Higher code mixtures improve performance in arithmetic and compositionality in domains whose output has formal structure (like semantic parsing). Conversely, increased exposure to code can harm language model performance on purely-linguistic tasks and tasks involving factual knowledge. We conduct permutation tests to study the impact of pretraining on downstream tasks and show that code pretraining increases the variance on task performance while raising the performance on the upper-quartile of tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "# 2 Related Work\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier work has studied whether pretraining on code is beneficial for non-programming tasks. Observational studies have looked at the impact of code on downstream performance post-hoc. Fu & Khot (2022) speculated that code pretraining is at least partially responsible for the improvement in capabilities between the -001 and -002 series of GPT-3(.5) models, specifically highlighting chain-of-thought reasoning, long-term dependency sensitivity, and “complex reasoning” as likely resulting from code pretraining. Yang et al. (2024b) provides a broad study of how code impacts language model capabilities, arguing that code improves complex reasoning and structured data understanding. Mueller et al. (2024) shows that code pretraining improves generalization on syntax-sensitive in-context learning tasks. By contrast, Coda-Forno et al. (2024), in an observational study, conclude that code pretraining does not improve model performance on a benchmark of behavioral tasks motivated by cognitive psychology. Kim et al. (2024) show that code pretraining improves models’ entity-tracking capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several experimental studies on the impact of code pretraining have also been conducted. Ma et al. (2024) attempt to verify the impact of code experimentally, comparing the 2.6 B parameter CodePanGu2.6 model.\n"
